# Vintage Grit Textures
A collection of animated vintage grit textures.

Based on my previous [grunge textures pack](https://github.com/darriagada/Gritkit), you can use these as overlays in your videos to give them a more vintage _cartoony_ look just by drag & drop and little tweaking.

### Download
You can download the [latest release here](https://github.com/darriagada/vintage-grit-textures/releases) â€” Current version is **1.0**

### References
These are some samples that you can find inside. You can also [see them in action here](https://vimeo.com/462230867).

### Recommended Software
* I recommend **Adobe After Effects** or any other video compositing software that uses blending modes.
* If you want to edit the textures files to create your own versions, you can use **Adobe Photoshop** or any other image editing software that can handle PSD files.
